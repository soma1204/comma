You've successfully made a PR and merged your code to the master branch. Congratulations! If you'd like to dive a little deeper, check out the files in this Git101 folder for even more tips and tricks on using git and GitHub. 

I also recommend finding some time to work with your team on simulating a smaller group project like we did here. Have your team make a new folder with your team name, and add some files with text to it. Then, try pushing those changes to this remote repo. That way, your team can start making changes to files they didn't originally create and practice using the PR feature. And, use the git blame and git history tools on GitHub to get familiar with tracking which changes have been made in a file and who made those changes.
